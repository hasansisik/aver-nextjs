      - **Transparency**: All transactions are visible to anyone in the network
      - **Immutability**: Once recorded, data cannot be changed or deleted
      - **Security**: Cryptographic techniques protect data integrity
      - **Consensus**: Network participants must agree on the validity of transactions

      ## Applications in Marketing

      Blockchain technology has several potential applications in digital marketing:

      1. **Ad Fraud Prevention**: Verifying ad delivery and audience metrics
      2. **Supply Chain Transparency**: Tracking products from manufacture to delivery
      3. **Customer Data Protection**: Giving users control over their personal data
      4. **Loyalty Programs**: Creating secure, transferable digital tokens as rewards
      5. **Content Licensing**: Managing digital rights and content ownership

      ## Challenges and Limitations
